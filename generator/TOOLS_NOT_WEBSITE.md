# 🚨 IMPORTANT: Development Tools Directory

**This directory contains DEVELOPMENT TOOLS, not part of the website!**

## ⚠️ What This Is

This `generator/` directory contains **standalone tools** for creating content for the Sonce website. These are **NOT part of the live website** - they are development utilities that run on your local computer.

## 🛠️ What's Inside

- **`html-editor/`** - Web-based news editor (opens in browser)
- **`news_generator.py`** - Desktop news generator (Python GUI)
- **`examples/`** - Sample news posts
- **`scripts/`** - Build and packaging tools

## 🎯 Purpose

These tools help you create **Markdown files with YAML frontmatter** that are compatible with the main website's news system. They generate the content files that the website then displays.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start:
```bash
# Python GUI (desktop app):
./run_mac_linux.sh    # Mac/Linux
run_windows.bat       # Windows

# HTML Editor (web app):
./run_html_editor.sh  # Mac/Linux  
run_html_editor.bat  # Windows
```

## 🔒 Safety Notes

- ✅ **Safe to modify** - changes don't affect the live website
- ✅ **Runs locally** - no internet required
- ✅ **No tracking** - completely private
- ✅ **Version controlled** - you can commit changes

## 📖 Documentation

See `README.md` in this directory for complete documentation.

**TL;DR**: These are **content creation tools**, not the website itself! They help you write news posts that the website will display. 🛠️
