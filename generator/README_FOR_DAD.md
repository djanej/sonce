## Tips for Dad

‚úÖ **Keep titles short and clear**
- Good: "Summer Festival Next Week"
- Too long: "The Annual Summer Festival Will Be Happening Next Week On Saturday"

‚úÖ **Write like you're telling a friend**
- Simple words work best
- 2-3 sentences is perfect

‚úÖ **Pictures make news better**
- But they're optional
- Any photo from your computer works
